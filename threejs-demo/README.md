# Three.js Demo

This folder contains a minimal example of rendering an **animated** 3D avatar using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It loads the Fox glTF model from the KhronosGroup sample models repository and plays its included animation. Use this page to verify that your browser can display animated 3D content.

To view the demo, start the Open-LLM-VTuber server and navigate to `http://localhost:12393/threejs-demo/` in your browser.
